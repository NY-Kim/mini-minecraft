Milestone 1: Procedural Terrain

2019-11-16 1:20PM 
Veronica explained what Hannah told her about ray-marching. She told me the concept/logic of it which was used for my add/delete block function.

2019-11-16 1:50PM 
Alexis explained to me how to safely get my partner's work from her branch and work on my branch and not mess it up with others using git.
Also she explained the concept of ray-intersection further.

2019-11-17 4:00PM
Helen explained to me how to avoid diagonally adding block and determine the face that ray hits, to properly draw new block next to the face, not by the edge/corner of the block.

2019 11-17 5:00PM 
I was inefficiently creating chunks and setting blocks for generating additional terrain. Jake suggested me to just iterate to the blocks of "new terrain", instead of initializing the chunks first then setting blocks for each of them.

Milestone 2: L-System Rivers

2019-11-27 2:50PM 
Adam explained to me, where the random number should come in in the river generation. I was not understanding the instructions 100%. Also, he told me how to call the functions from map with function pointers(syntax).

2019-11-27 3:20PM 
Ryan gave me an insight for generating river and also smooth transition between terrains. Also he told me about using hemisphere for better looking carving out effect.

Milestone 3: Biomes

2019-12-3 12:00PM 
Nick explained how to use Worley noise function for biome implementation.

2019-12-3 12:40PM 
Adam explained to me, how I should approach the biomes part. He explained using peril-noise function to decide "moist", "bumpy" value for each coordinate, which are used to determine type of a biome that coordinate lies in. Also, he suggested using smooth step for interpolating heights between biomes for better looks.

2019-12-7 10:30PM 
Veronica told me she couldn't figure out problem in her peril-noise, so Jake suggested her to use fbm noise function instead, for getting moist-bump value. My peril-noise was not working too, so I took her advice to use fbm instead.

Milestone 1: Terrain Rendering and Chunking

2019-11-16 1:12AM 
Looked up how to iterate std::map

2019-11-17 1:36PM
Blocks in negative-x or negative-z values won't draw correctly. Made a several fixes.
- updated all my functions to support negative values (find correct origin of chunk)
- changed my key structure of Terrain::m_chunks to be std::pair<int, int> instead of int64_t (std::pair is hashable) 

2019-11-17 1:38PM 
Looked up how to remove DS_Store files

Milestone 2: Texturing and Texture Animation

2019-11-25 8:30PM
Adel and Eddie helped me make changes in myGL for my textures to load (bind(0) & load(0)) function

2019-12-01 6:39PM
Transparent blocks weren't showing correctly -> Draw all the opaque blocks first, then draw transparent blocks

Milestone 3: Fog, Inventory, Procedural Grass/Snow Color
2019-12-10 2:12AM How to find key through value in std::map
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51587127/efficient-way-to-get-key-from-stdmap-value

2019-12-13 2:51AM Reference noise functions from GLSL Noise Algorithms
https://gist.github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/670c22f3966e662d2f83

For fog, I inferences the code Adam wrote during class. But made it brighter to give a more majestic feeling.

Used https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35064362/cannot-iterate-over-map-whose-elements-hold-a-uniq-ptr/35064887 to help iterate through a map with unique pointers

Milestone 3: Post-Process Shader and Sound
2019-12-06 11:27 AM
Used https://www.qtcentre.org/threads/55257-QSound-No-such-file-or-directory to figure out why says QSound no such file
