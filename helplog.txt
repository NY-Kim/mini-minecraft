Veronica explained what Hannah told her about ray-marching. She told me the concept/logic of it which was used for my add/delete block function.

Alexis explained to me how to safely get my partner's work from her branch and work on my branch and not mess it up with others using git.
Also she explained the concept of ray-intersection further.

Helen explained to me how to avoid diagonally adding block and determine the face that ray hits, to properly draw new block next to the face, not by the edge/corner of the block.

I was inefficiently creating chunks and setting blocks for generating additional terrain. Jake suggested me to just iterate to the blocks of "new terrain", instead of initializing the chunks first then setting blocks for each of them.

Blocks in negative-x or negative-z values won't draw correctly. Made a several fixes.
- updated all my functions to support negative values (find correct origin of chunk)
- changed my key structure of Terrain::m_chunks to be std::pair<int, int> instead of int64_t (std::pair is hashable)

Adel and Eddie helped me make changes in myGL for my textures to load (bind(0) & load(0)) function

Transparent blocks weren't showing correctly -> Draw all the opaque blocks first, then draw transparent blocks
